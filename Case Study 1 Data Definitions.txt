A Wal-Mart wants to see what level of “roll-back” sales attract which customers

–MarkDown1 = regular price; MarkDown2 = first level of roll-back
–Level of roll-back discounts are not shared; assume that that they are proportionate across goods

Your job: Predict how much revenue 10 new random customers will generate. Write an actionable memo that tells this. Your memo should also discuss something that doesn’t make sense.

Also fill in the blanks on the 16 ones with missing gender / age

What you should do:

1. Look at each roll-back level by demographic

2. Look at new customers and estimate (a) their purchases by roll-back level; and (b) how much they will be worth to the store
